I am currently a grauduate student at Georgia Institute of Technology, completing a Masters of Science in Computer Science. I am also employed by the University of Pennsylvania GRASP Lab (General Robotics Automation Sensing & Perception), performing research with Dr. Kostas Daniilidis. My current projects, Style Disentanglement and Human Pose, are in collaboration with art historian William Schmenner and the Frick Collection. My undergraduate degree was a Bachelors of Science in Statistics, completed at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) in 2019.
